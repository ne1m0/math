Calculate the revenue from selling the remaining eggs at $2 per egg.\n\nLet's start with the first step:\n\n1. Janet's ducks lay 16 eggs per day.\n\nNext, we calculate how many eggs Janet eats and bakes for herself each day:\n\n2. Janet eats 3 eggs for breakfast every morning.\n3. Janet bakes 4 eggs for her friends every day.\n\nSo, the total number of eggs Janet eats and bakes for herself each day is:\n\\[ 3 + 4 = 7 \\text{ eggs} \\]\n\nNow, we find out how many eggs are left to be sold:\n\\[ 16 - 7 = 9 \\text{ eggs} \\]\n\nFinally, we calculate the revenue from selling the remaining eggs at $2 per egg:\n\\[ 9 \\times 2 = 18 \\text{ dollars} \\]\n\nTherefore, Janet makes \\boxed{18} dollars every day at the farmers' market."}
